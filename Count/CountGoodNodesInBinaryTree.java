 * 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree
 * Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.
 * Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.
 * The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
 * Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].
