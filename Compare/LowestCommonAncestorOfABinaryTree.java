 * 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
 *
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
 * “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest
 * node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
 * -109 <= Node.val <= 109
 * All Node.val are unique.
 * p != q
 * p and q will exist in the tree.
